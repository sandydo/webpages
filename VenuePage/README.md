# Webpage for better excess to a venue list

We want to provide the venue list of Gil Hockman as a database for musicians all over the world. In order to have good excess to the list we want to build an online interface which allows reading and writing to the list.

General ideas and wishes:

1. The excess should be controlled, so that the owner knows who and how many are using the list. (User-login? Google Analytics?)
2. Commentary on venues should be possible. Rating also for example.


**2Do**:
1. Find a good relational data structure and import the tabular in SQL.
2. Set up a small online server and www domain (provider: gandi.net ?)
3. Build up the online interface (html, css) and provide excess to the database (php, SQL ?)
